# NewsFeed
I implemented this by HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JAVASCRIPT with ajax. It can feed news and display the news you want. There is a time button by which choosing the news on specific is feasible. Clicking the titles of news can achieve the content.

Since it involves in MySQL, setting up a local server is necessary. In PHP files, command lines, "$con = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "12345678", "ycchen");", are required to modified and import SQL file to build a local server where these codes work on.

There is a PDF file to show how this work works properly.
